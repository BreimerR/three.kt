# three.kt (Work in progress - still not 100% functional)

Kotlin/JVM port of the popular [three.js](http://threejs.org) 3D library ([r106](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r106)).

## Looking for the Kotlin/JS wrapper project?
It has been renamed and moved to [here](https://github.com/markaren/three-kt-wrapper).
